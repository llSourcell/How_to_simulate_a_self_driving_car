This is the code for "How to Simulate a Self-Driving Car" by Siraj Raval on Youtube

# This video will be released on Wednesday, May 17th at 10 AM PST. This code is a work in progress.

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/EaY5QiZwSP4) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. We're going to use Udacity's [self driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) as a testbed for training an autonomous car. 

## Dependencies

You can install all dependencies by running one of the following commands

You need a [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) to use the environment setting.

```python
# Use TensorFlow without GPU
conda env create -f environments.yml 

# Use TensorFlow with GPU
conda env create -f environments-gpu.yml
```

Or you can manually install the required libraries (see the contents of the environemnt*.yml files) using pip.


## Usage


### Run the pretrained model

Start up [the Udacity self-driving simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), choose a scene and press the Autonomous Mode button.  Then, run the model as follows:

```python
python drive.py model.h5
```

### Generating data

Start up [the Udacity self-driving simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), choose a scene and press the Training Mode button.  Then, press R to choose directory for data. After choosing directory press R to start recording. Drive for around 5 laps and press R again to capture data.

### Preprocessing images

run:
```python
python preprocess_images.py
```

### Training the model

You'll need the data folder which contains the training images.

```python
python model.py
```

This will generate a file `model-<epoch>-<val_loss>.h5` whenever the performance in the epoch is better than the previous best.
